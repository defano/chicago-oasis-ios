See how accessible your Chicago neighborhood is to different types of businesses from the serious to the inane: Do you live in a food desert or within an oasis of kennels and catteries? Is your census tract home to more tattoo parlors than anywhere else in the Second City? 

Use Chicago Oasis to explore and discover business accessibility throughout the city. Learn which businesses would create a desert if they were to close and examine the demographic profiles of each of Chicago's 77 officially recognized community areas. Chicago Oasis offers a visualization of each business license category issued by the City of Chicago for each year that data is publicly available.
