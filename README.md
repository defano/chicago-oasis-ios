# Chicago Oasis for iOS

Available for download on the [iTunes App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/ios/id36?mt=8) soon.

A fully-native Swift implementation of the Chicago Oasis project for iOS devices. This "universal" app (runs on both iPhones and iPads)
pulls demographic, critical business, and accessibility data from the http://chicago-oasis.org web site and renders it using Apple's MapKit.

See the Chicago Oasis project for a general overview of the project and details about how the data was generated.
